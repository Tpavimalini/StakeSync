# StakeSync

## 🏆 Built for StakeKit x Safe Agentathon
This project integrates **StakeKit API** in `src/services/main.ts` to manage liquidity, optimize yields, and automate DeFi strategies.

## 🚀 Overview- my idea
**StakeSync** is an AI-powered **DeFi Smart Account** that utilizes a Multi-Agent Liquidity Swarm to optimize profits across arbitrage, lending, and staking. Unlike traditional bots that focus only on arbitrage, StakeSync dynamically shifts liquidity in real-time based on user preferences and risk levels.

## 🔥 Key Features

### 1️⃣ AI Multi-Agent Swarm
StakeSync deploys multiple AI agents working together to maximize returns:
- **Arbitrage Agent** – Scans DEXs and executes flash loan arbitrage.
- **Lending Agent** – Moves funds to high-yield lending protocols
- **Staking Agent** – Stakes assets in for passive yield.
- **Risk Agent** – Continuously monitors liquidation risks & potential rug pulls.

💡 **Why It Matters?**
Instead of focusing solely on arbitrage, StakeSync **dynamically reallocates funds** across arbitrage, lending, and staking to ensure maximum yield generation.

### 2️⃣ Personalized Portfolio Management
Users can customize their investment strategy based on risk preferences:
- **Low-Risk Mode** → More staking, less arbitrage.
- **Medium-Risk Mode** → A balanced mix of staking, lending, and arbitrage.
- **High-Risk Mode** → Aggressive flash loans and high-yield farming.

💡 **Why It Matters?**
Unlike standard bots that execute fixed strategies, StakeSync **adapts to user preferences**, ensuring an optimized and personalized yield strategy.

### 3️⃣ Security & Risk Monitoring
Traditional DeFi bots lack built-in risk protection. StakeSync changes that by:
✅ **Real-Time Risk Monitoring**
- **Detects liquidation threats** (e.g., collateral at risk).
- **Monitors impermanent loss** to prevent unfavorable LP positions.
- **Scans for smart contract exploits** before interacting with any protocol.

💡 **Why It Matters?**
Users get **safer and more sustainable profits** instead of blindly running arbitrage strategies that could lead to losses.

### 4️⃣ Safe Smart Account Integration
Instead of relying on external wallets like MetaMask, StakeSync utilizes **Safe Smart Accounts**:
- **Batch Transactions** – Saves gas fees.
- **Multi-Chain Support** – Works on Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, etc.
- **Enhanced Security** – Eliminates the need for manual approvals.

💡 **Why It Matters?**
Users can **deposit funds once**, and the AI autonomously manages everything securely.
